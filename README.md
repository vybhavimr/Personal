# ProjectSolactive
How to run the project (preferably with maven Spring Boot plugin or alike, or as an
executable jar):

Please use the command "mvn spring-boot:run".Project has been created using Spring Boot.


Which assumptions you made while developing:

I assumed that we would have multiple ticks coming for the same instrument Id
I have assumed that to support concurrent requests we can have the etag generation to support the same

What would you improve if you had more time:

I would improve the test coverage provided and also cover with more negative test cases too

And, whether you liked the challenge or not:

The challenge very insightful and a very very good learning experience as I have never had a working experience 
with Spring Boot and also writing test cases for the same.
